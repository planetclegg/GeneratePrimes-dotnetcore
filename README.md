## GeneratePrimes-dotnetcore

Just playing around with .NET 5 on a M1 Mac...

The library (PlanetClegg.Utils.Primes) generates prime numbers with a sieve.   The 
code is reasonably optimized for what it is:  Uses BitArray, ignores even 
numbers, skips over obvious numbers that have already been marked off, etc. 
On an M1 it can generate all primes up to 2^31-1 (which is itself a Mersenne prime)
in about 10 seconds in a release build, with no real attempt to optimize it very 
much beyond the basic algorithm.  Any significant improvements would 
best be done with a better algorithm.

There are xUnit tests (Utils.Tests) and a console runner app.  

Addendum: Out of curiosity, I've done several micro-optimizations over the original 
in the classes OptimizedPrimeSieve / Optimized64PrimeSieve: eliminating the function call 
overhead from using BitArray, and pre-setting multiples of 3 & 5 with a rotating bit wheel.
Resulted in a 30% speedup, but probably not worth the loss of readability.  Strangely, 
the 'Optimized64' version runs a little faster than the 'Optimized' on Intel (as I expected), 
but a little slower on an M1. The difference between these two versions is merely
that one does bit-twiddling on uints, and the other on ulongs.

The M1 beats my Intel boxes either way, even though it is running in rosetta2 (!!!)

NOTE: I'm seeing evidence that CLR JITing and/or the OS scheduler is skewing these
tests a bit.  Needs a better benchmark runner to get more consistent results.
